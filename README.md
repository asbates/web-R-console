## Welcome to webR!

This repository is an experiment with [webR](https://github.com/r-wasm/webr) which just had their first release.
`webR` is a project to bring R to the browser by compiling it to Web Assembly.

For this project I created a simple React application containing an R console.
The editor I use is [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) via a [React component](https://uiwjs.github.io/react-codemirror/).

You can find this site deployed with Netflify at [https://gregarious-gumdrop-801aff.netlify.app/](https://gregarious-gumdrop-801aff.netlify.app/).

To run locally, clone this repo the run the following commands.

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```
